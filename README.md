Story

Midoria was a peaceful world heavy with forests and a prosperous Elven Kingdom.
Until one dark stormy night, three powerful dark sorcerers begin a potent ritual.
combining their powers to rip their reality into another world,
powerful lightning bolts strike into the air,
changing the sky from blue to several colours.
Otherworldly creatures of all sizes invade from above.
The once prosperous Elven Kingdom crumbles into anarchy under the strain.
Villages only have a Shipyard, Inn, Junk and Potion Houses left standing.
You must step up and help the Kingdom fight back these creatures and reclaim the skies.
